# Minimal microstate example (HID)

This folder illustrates the required inputs for a microstate. These files are placeholders
and are not meant for real RESP fitting. Replace them with your real data under `data/microstates/`.

Expected layout:

- `HID.pdb`
- `symmetry-buckets/r8.dat`
- `terachem/espxyz/conf0.esp.xyz`
- `terachem/respout/conf0.resp.out`
